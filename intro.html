<h1>Playing with Stata</h1>
<b>Random topics, and interesting questions (at least to me) using my tool of Choice Stata!</b>
<br><br>
Welcome, and thanks for joining me.  As you will read in this "blog" (a description I'm not too fond of)/site, I cover series of random topics of questions in applied econometrics using my favorite tool Stata!.
<br><br>
That being said. This website is multipurpose. 
<br><br>
I started it to answer random questions of "how to" do things in Stata, that I had troubles with at some point. Spread the knowledge if you may. However it will also be used as a teaching tool for some simple and not-so-simple topics and strategies I teach in econometrics class.
<br><br>
Finally, I will also use it as a platform to share my research, whenever possible, and pertinent. 
<br><br>
