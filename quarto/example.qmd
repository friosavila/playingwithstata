## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

It also enables you to run Stata code!

```{stata}

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{stata}
sysuse auto
scatter price mpg
```

But of course, you can also create tables

```{stata}
*| echo: false
*| output: asis
qui:reg price mpg foreign

esttab m1, md nonum
```
