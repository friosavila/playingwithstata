{synoptline}
{synopt :{opt depvar}} Declares the dependent variable or outcome of interest. {p_end}
{synopt :{opt indepvar}} Declares the independent variable or controls. Depending
on the estimation method, all declared variables will be used for the outcome regression model, 
the propensity score estimator, or both. {p_end}
{synopt :} One can use factor notation. Only base period values are used in the model estimation. {p_end}
{synoptline}

{syntab:{bf: DiD Model Specification}}
{synopthdr}
{synoptline}
{synopt:{opt i:var(varname)}} Variable used as panel identifier. e.g., {it:country}. When declared, the model assumes the data 
has a panel structure, and will apply panel estimators. When no variable is declared the command assumes data are
 repeated crosssection (RC), and applies RC estimators. {p_end}
 
{synopt:{opt t:ime(varname)}} Variable to identify time. e.g., {it:year}. Periods do not need to be consecutive, but
the variable is expected to be strictly positive. {p_end}

{synopt:{opt gvar(varname)}} Variable identifying treatment groups or cohorts. Groups that are never treated should be coded as Zero. 
Any positive value indicates which year a group was initially treated. And once a group is treated, the underlying assumption
is that it always remains treated. {p_end}

{synopt:} e.g., 0 Never treated, 10 treat at t=10, 20 treated at time 20, 25 treated at time 25. {p_end}

{synopt:} If there are any groups treated before the first available period in the sample, those observations are 
considered always treated, and are excluded from the sample. {p_end}

{synopt:} For every cohort in {it:gvar} there should be a period in {it:time} otherwise, the command will produce an error. {p_end}

{synopt:} When using panel data, observations cannot change cohort across time. {p_end}

{synopt:{opt notyet}} Request using observations never treated and those not yet treated as control group. 
The default is using never treated only. If there are no {it:never treated} observations, notyet is used automatically.{p_end}

{synoptline}
{syntab:{bf: Estimation Method} }

{phang}
{cmd: csdid} is a generalization of {help drdid}, and as such it allows for various estimators.
It estimates every feasible 2x2 DiD design available in the selected sample. 
{p_end}

{phang}
In all cases, base-period covariates are used for the estimation of the propensity score and outcome regressions.
{p_end}

{phang}
To specify a particular syntax, one should use the option {cmd: method({it:method})} using one of the following key words:

{syntab:{bf: Standard Error Options}}

{phang}By default, robust and asymptotic standard errors are estimated, which are obtained using Influence Functions.
 However other options are available. {p_end}

{synopthdr}
{synoptline}

{synopt:wboot}Request Estimation of Standard errors using a multiplicative WildBootstrap procedure.
The default uses 999 repetitions using mammen approach. {p_end}

{synopt:reps(#)}Specifies the number of repetitions to be used for the Estimaton of the WBoot SE. Default is 999 {p_end}

{synopt:wtype(type)}Specifies the type of Wildbootstrap procedure. The default is "mammen", but "rademacher" is also 
avilable.{p_end}

{synopt:rseed(#)}Specifies the seed for the WB procedure. Use for replication purposes.{p_end}

{synopt:cluster(clust var)}Request the estimation of Clustered Standard errors. This option is valid for asymptotic Standard errors,
and Wbootstrap Standard errors.{p_end}

{synopt:}Remark 1. When Panel estimators are used, asymptotic and Wbootstrap Standard errors are already clustered at the panel level.
When using cluster, one is effectively requesting a two-way cluster estimation.{p_end}
{synopt:}Remark 2. When Panel estimators are used, The panel id should be nested within the cluster variable . (ivar) {p_end}

{syntab:{bf: Other Options}}

{synopthdr}
{synoptline}

{synopt:saverif(filename)}Request the command to save the RIFs for all the DID ATT into a dataset name {it:filename}. 
It requires a new dataset unless option {cmd: replace} is used. {p_end}
{synopt:}In addition to the ATT's RIFs, the file also contains the RIFs for the weights that are used for aggregations. {p_end}

{synopt:replace}In combination with {cmd:saverif()}, requests replacing the file if it already exists {p_end}

{synopt:}Remark 1: This option can be combined with wildbootstrap standard errors. {p_end}
{synopt:}Remark 2: This option is used as an alternative to -estimates save-, so you can request other aggregations
or SE after the model has been estimated. {p_end}

{synopt:agg(aggtype)}This option can be used to produce different aggregations as the command output. The default is 
{cmd: attgt}, which produces the ATT for a particular cohort, and a particular period. Other options are: {p_end}

{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:csdid} implements the DiD with multiple periods estimator proposed by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020). {p_end}

{pstd}Internally, all 2x2 DiD estimates (ATTGT's) are obtained using -drdid-. Thus {cmd: csdid} works as a wrapper
that determines all relevant designs and aggregates them. {p_end}
 
{pstd}As in -drdid-, the underlying assumption is that all covariates are time constant. When using panel data, 
even if covariates are time varying, only the base-period values are used for the estimation. 
{p_end}
 
{pstd}
When using crossection data, while all characteristics can be consider time varying, the underlying assumption is that 
within treated and untreated group, characteristics are stationary (time constant). In other words, 
be careful of controling for characteristics that are either time constant (e.g. sex or race), or for 
pretreatment characteristics.
{p_end}
 
{pstd}
The intuition behind Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) estimator is that in order to obtain consistent estimators for ATT's
one should only use never-treated or not-yet treated units as controls. Otherwise, under heterogenous treatment effects, 
the parallel trends assumption will be violated, and the estimations of the effects could be severily biased.
{p_end}

{pstd}
When all units fall ATTGT corresponds to a case where all observations are not yet treated, those can be used as a test for
pretrends. 
{p_end}

{pstd}
For the command to work, you need to have at least one period in the data for each group/cohort in gvar. You also require 
at least one period previous to a cohort/group, in order to estimate the ATT for that cohort.
{p_end}

{pstd}
From the perspective of the treated observations, all ATTGT's are estimated using the last not treated period as "base-period"
using current period as the post period. The control groups are selected for the same points in time.
{p_end}

{pstd}
For ATT's before the treatment took place use T-1 as the base period (or Pre-period), and T as the post-period. 
For ATT's after the treatment took place use G-1 as the base period (pre-treatment period) and T as the post-period.
{p_end}

{pstd}
Because the estimator attempts to estimate all ATTGT's for all groups across all periods, the implementation of this estimator
for crossection data with long time spans and many treated groups may not be feasible. For example, using 30 periods, with 20 potential 
groups would require the estimation of 600 separate regressions, and the creation of at least the same number of new variables
containing the RIF's for all ATTGT's, rapidily consuming the memory resources of commonly used computers. 
{p_end}

{pstd}
The best advice on this cases is refine the treatment groups or cohorts, because not all of them may be relevant for your analysis. 
Additionally, you may not need ALL periods, requiring only few periods before the first treatment year.


{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
When using panel data, the estimator does not require data to be strongly balance. However, when estimating each ATTGT,
only observations that are balance within a specific 2x2 designed are used for the estimator. You will see a warning 
if something like this is detected in the data.
{p_end}
{pstd}
This approach is in contrast with the default approach in R's DID. When unbalanced data exists, the default is to 
estimate the model using Repeated Crossection estimators. See the example below constrasting both approaches.
{p_end}
{pstd}
Even if WBootstrap SE are requested, asymtotic SE are in e().
