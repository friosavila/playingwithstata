<h2 id="drdid-version-135">DRDID Version 1.35</h2>
<p>Hello everyone, this should be a quick note on the forth beta version for <code>drdid</code> command for Stata. You probably already saw the post by Miklos, which gives provides instructions to download the package. So, you can either install it through there, or just copy the files I provide here.</p>
<p>Since I'll be maintaining the package, both sites will have the same information. Except that here I provide a bit more of my flair. (artistic freedom)</p>
<p>Almost two weeks of &quot;Serious-Series-of-Serious&quot; Mata and Stata programming (Yes One punch man), I completed a version of the command that replicates R's <code>DRDID</code>. The command produces both panel and repeated crossection estimators proposed in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020), plus one done using <code>teffects</code>: The Inverse Probability Weighting Augmented regression estimator (for panel data). While I have not included this on the helpfile yet (still need to fix some of its features), the command now allows you to use weights (which will be used as pweights), and can also produce the 1-step wild-bootstrap.</p>
<p>For the case of the Wbootstrap, however, the command only produces CI based on normal distribution, and not based on the symetric t-stat as is used in the original <code>DRDID</code> package.</p>
<p>One more aspect the command will integrate, thanks to EP (who wishes to remain anonymous), will be the estimation of the <code>DRDID</code> via <code>gmm</code>. This approach is not yet implemented, but its being programmed as we speak. This will provide a richer set of options to estimate and standard errors, and may even allow you to use different explanatory variables in the outcome and probability model.</p>
<p>Alright, I hope this guide helps in using this command, at least until is properly released through SSC. Please if you find any bugs or difficulties, do not hesitate to contact me at <a href="mailto:friosa@gmail.com">friosa@gmail.com</a>, or throught twitter!</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>For the replication exercise, I ll use the same dataset used in the example for the drdid command in R. Let's call it lalonde.dta.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>use https://friosavila.github.io/playingwithstata/drdid/lalonde.dta, clear
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>Then, you may need to make sure to copy the files <a href="https://friosavila.github.io/playingwithstata/drdid/drdid.ado">drdid.ado</a> in your personal ado folder. For my pc, it's in <code>C:\ado\personal</code>. You could also install the files typing:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>net install drdid, from (&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friosavila/csdid_drdid/v0.1/code&quot;)
</div></code></code></pre>
<h2 id="drdid-in-action">drdid in action</h2>
<p>I tried to keep the syntax of drdid relatively standard. At least standard with other commands I have worked before. So some of the options may change slightly, as other features are integrated.</p>
<p>The general syntax of the command is as follows</p>
<pre><code><code><div>drdid depvar [indepvar] [if] [in] [iw], [ivar(varname)] time(varname) tr(varname) [estimator] [boot]
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>Here an explanation of all the pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>depvar</code></strong> : is your dependent variable or outcome of interest</li>
<li><strong><code>indepvar</code></strong>: are your independent variables, you may or may not have variables here. These variables will included in the outcome regression specification and the propensity score estimation.</li>
<li><strong><code>ivar</code></strong>: is a variable that identifies the panel ID. If you drop this, the command will use repeated crossection estimators instead. If included, it will estimate the panel estimators. This option may change to groupvar.</li>
<li><strong><code>time</code></strong>: identifies the time variable (for example year). It does not matter if the periods are contiguous or not. However, its important that you have only 2 values in <code>time</code> for the working sample. The earlier period will be used as <code>pre</code> , whereas the later period will be used as `post'.</li>
<li><strong><code>tr</code></strong>: is the treatment variable. It does not matter what values you use, as long as there are only two values in the used sample. Observations with lower values are the <code>control group</code>, whereas observations with the higher values are the <code>treated groups</code>.</li>
<li><strong><code>estimator</code></strong> is used to indicate which estimator you want to use. Below the list of all that is available:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>drimp</code></strong> Estimates the DR improved estimator. If you add <code>rc1</code> it provides you with the alternative estimator (that is not locally efficient)</li>
<li><strong><code>dripw</code></strong> Estimates the DR IPW estimator. You can also use <code>rc1</code> to provide the alternative (not locally efficient) estimator.</li>
<li><strong><code>reg</code></strong> Estimates the Outcome regression estimator.</li>
<li><strong><code>stdipw</code></strong> Estimates the Standard IPW estimator.</li>
<li><strong><code>ipw</code></strong> Estimates the estimator similar to Abadies (2005)</li>
<li><strong><code>ipwra</code></strong> Estimates the IPW regression augmented estimator. This is estimated through <code>Stata</code> command <code>teffects ipwra</code>. Not available for Repeated Crossection</li>
<li><strong><code>all</code></strong> Provides all estimators. Perhaps you may find it useful for robustness. (I did it for replication). This results cannot be used to make comparison across estimators.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>boot</code></strong>: When used, the command will estimate the 1-step wild-bootstrap (or multiplier bootstrap), with 999 repetions. It currently implements Mammen(1993) approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how does this work? Lets start with the lanlonde dataset, and the Panel estimators. For a quick application, I ll use the <code>all</code> option:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>drdid re age educ black married nodegree hisp re74 if treated==0 | sample==2 , ivar(id) time(year) tr( experimental )  all 
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>and if everything went well, you should be seeing this:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>For the Repeated Cross section estimator, I will use the simulated dataset provided also in R's <code>DRDID</code>.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>use https://friosavila.github.io/playingwithstata/drdid/sim_rc.dta, clear
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>And let me use the same syntax as before, to obtain all estimates at the same time. Notice that I'm not including the &quot;ivar&quot; indicator. So the command uses the repeated crossection estimators:</p>
<pre><code><code><div>. drdid y x1 x2 x3 x4, time(post) tr( d)   all

<p>And that is it!. Please, if you find any bugs or encounter any problems. Let me know. So, what is next?</p>
<h1 id="csdid-version-10">CSDID Version 1.0</h1>
<p>Yes, <code>CSDID</code> is here!.</p>
<p>This took longer, just because I was a bit burned with the first week of <code>DRDID</code> coding. Even having the base code (Thank you Pedro!) it was hard to understand how each moving piece moved. And, if you do not understand how it all moves, you cannot move forward.</p>
<p>In any case...Yes, It clicked again, and we have a beta version!</p>
<p>I used to add information about <code>CSDID</code> here, but since it has just been completed, I'll create its own page!
Please use the menu on the right, and go to the new corresponding page.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next-for-drdid">what is next for <code>DRDID</code>?</h2>
<ol>
<li><code>drdid</code> is basically done. I do need to include an option for clusters. So that may come next. Weights are already incorporated, but needs testing.</li>
<li>Along with E.P., we are also working on adding <code>gmm</code> estimators to <code>drdid</code>. It will just be to provide you with more options for analysis and report. He also provided a new Display. function.</li>
<li>There is also the &quot;problem&quot; of Wild Bootstrap. The code its done, but display is missing (the standard errors)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have comments or questions, please, let me know!</p>
