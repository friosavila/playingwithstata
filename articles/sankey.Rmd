# Disclaimer

I should start by saying that what I will be presenting here is ***not*** the only way. Just they way I like to make this kind of plot, specially after some programming muscle flexing, and when I do not want to type the same text over and over again.

That being said. A step by step guide on this plot can be found [here](https://medium.com/the-stata-guide/stata-graphs-sankey-diagram-ecddd112aca1). 

Learning how to do it step-by-step gives your more flexibility, but I hope you will find that using [`sankey_i2`](./sankey_files/sankey_i2.ado) is sufficiently flexible for most of your purposes.

Also, I just found out that there is a python application that was linked to Stata! You can find a link to application [here](https://www.mjcrowther.co.uk/software/sankey/)

So let me start

## What are Sankey plots?

According to Wikipedia, Sankey plots are :

> A type of flow diagram in which the width of the arrows is proportional to the flow rate.

> And are often used in the visualization of material flow analysis.

## But what they, really?

When you think about it, at its core, Sankey plots are nothing more then graphs of connected coordinates. 

You have the origin point $(x0,y0)$ and the destiny point $(x1,y1)$, and you simply connect them with a line. Sounds Familiar? 

If that is the case, you could easily plot "ugly" Sankey plots using `Stata` command `pcspike`. The caveat: `pcspikes` draws straight lines, but Sankey uses nice smooth ones.

## But what they, really?

There are smaller details that go with it, but, as long as you have a set of pair coordinates, you can easily connect them, and voila! Sankey plot.

Getting the curved lines, however, may seem like a hassle. And even more trying to keep track of all the elements connections, colors, etc.

Thus, what I decided to do was write a small `ado` that makes creating this plots easy. 

In the next slides, I will show you how to use `sankey_i2` to make this type of plots, in Stata!. But first...

1. Get a copy of [`sankey_i2`](./sankey_files/sankey_i2.ado) and [`sankey_i`](./sankey_files/sankey_i.ado) in your computer.
2. Get Asjad `schemepack` from SSC. I really like `white_tableau` scheme. 

`sankey_i` and `sankey_i2` are independent from each other, but it will help you understand the data structure, and how the command works.

## Simple Sankey plot

Before we start with the heavy duty Sankey plot, Lets see how it actually works with a toy example.

Say that you want to Sankey-sh connection between two points. (0,0)-(1,1). 
What you would do is:

.panelset[
  .panel[.panel-name[Code]
  
  ```Stata
  sankey_i 0  0  1  1
    *->   x0 y0 x1 y1
  ```
  Notice with this command, you *feed* information for the two points you want to connect (x0,y0) to (x1,y1).
  
  The plot now will be almost identical to the one I produced before. The difference is that we can also play with other graph properties
  ]
  
  .panel[.panel-name[Plot]
  .center2[
   ![sankey_3](./sankey_files/sankey_2.png)
   ]
  ]
  
   .panel[.panel-name[Code]
  
  ```Stata
  sankey_i 0  0  1  -3  0.2 0.5
    *->   x0 y0 x1 y1   W0  w1
  ```
  In this example, I change the second coordinate, and add two other values. W0 (for width at point 1) and W1 for width at point 2.

  ]

## More Complex Sankey Plot

Alright, the idea of using `sankey_i`, is for you to become familiar with the order of the data you will need to have to produce a Sankey plot. 

Namely, you will need data for each pair of *links* you want to make (say `x0, y0, x1, y1`), but also variables with information about the Widths.

The basic syntax of the command, then will be:

```stata
  sankey_i2 vx0 vy0 vx1 vy0, <--necessary
  [width0(varname) <-- Var with WIDTH point0
   width1(varname) <-- Var with WIDTH point1 
   color(varname)  <-- Var with color 
   pstyle(varname) <-- Var with pstyle
   adjust          <-- Adjusts Nodes possition
   Other options]  <-- other code options
```

## More Complex Sankey Plot 

So we are almost ready to do your first Sankey plot.

First, I ll create some data, before making any plots

.panelset[
   .panel[.panel-name[Input Data]
Input the data:   
   
```stata
 input x0  y0  x1  y1   wd0  wd1 str10 color  str10 pstyle 
       0   0   2    2   0.5  0.2  "navy%50"  "p1"
	   0   0   2   -2   0.5  0.2  "brown%50"  "p1"
	   2   2   4    2   0.2  0.5  "navy%40"  "p2"
	   2   2   4    5   0.2  0.5  "brown%40"  "p2"
 end
```
   
   ]
   
   .panel[.panel-name[plot code]
Create a simple sankey plot. the coordinates should be added in the same order as with `sankey_i`.

```stata
sankey_i2 x0 y0 x1 y1
```

]
   
      
   .panel[.panel-name[plot]
  
  .pull-left[ ![sankey_5](./sankey_files/sankey_4.png)]
  .pull-right[
  
    Voila! First Sankey plot, with caveats.
    
- Lines are too thin
- Legend is Ugly
- and colors are Random.
    
  ]

   
   ]
]

## Beatify

.panelset[
   .panel[.panel-name[Goal]

The next step will be to make the plot better looking.
- How to change width's
- Adjust graph to width's
- Assign colors
- And assign styles

So lets do All of this at once!
   ]
   
   .panel[.panel-name[code]

The new code now has more information. 

- I can specify using different width's (at x0,y0 or x1,y1)
- Change color using a variable with color characteristics
- or adjust the flow positions.

```stata
sankey_i2 x0 y0 x1 y1, /// As before, we provide all coordinates
  width0(wd0)    /// Specifies the width at point1 
  width1(wd1)    /// If you ignore this, it will be set to wd0
  color(color)   /// Here you use a variable with the "colors" you want
  adjust         // and this adjusts the possitions (try it on)
```

   ]
   
   .panel[.panel-name[plot]

  .center2[ ![sankey_6](./sankey_files/sankey_5.png)]
  
It does look much better. Also, I could have created the same figure without adjustment, or using styles rather than color.
   ]
   
   .panel[.panel-name[plot2]

  .pull-left[ ![sankey_7a](./sankey_files/sankey_6.png)
  Here I use pstyle rather than color option
  ]
  
  .pull-right[ ![sankey_7b](./sankey_files/sankey_7.png)
  Here I use color, but drop `adjust`.
  ]
  
]
   
]

## Beatify 2

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Goal]
   
Alright, our sankey plot is ***DONE***! 

...or almost done. 

There is still need to add more information for a proper sankey plot. For now, those can be added using other `twoway` options.

At some point, It will be added to the command! but for now, lets see how to do it by hand

]

.panel[.panel-name[code]

```stata
sankey_i2 x0 y0 x1 y1, width0(wd0) width1(wd1) ///
  adjust color(color) ///
	xlabel("") ylabel("") legend(off) /// 
	text(0 0 "Beginning" 2 2 "Node 1" ///
	-2 2 "Node 2" 2 4 "Win" 5 4 "Loss", box width(15) ///
	orientation(vertical)) ///
	title("Your first sankey, the ado way") ///
	subtitle("This is the way")
```
So, we will use the option `text` to add the additional information we need.
As a reminder, text uses (y,x) coordinates to add the information.
]

.panel[.panel-name[plot]

![sankey_8](./sankey_files/sankey_8.png)]

## Conclusions

This was fun to code, and flex my programming muscles.

More important, I wanted make an "easy" way to construct this figures.

There is still some details to address. Specifically, Really would like to add the "text" automatically, but that is yet to be programmed. 

Comments? suggestions? Drop me a message!
