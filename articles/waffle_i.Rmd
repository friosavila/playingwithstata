# Disclaimer

I should start by saying that what I will be presenting here is ***not*** the only way. Just they way I like to make this kind of plot, specially after some programming muscle flexing, and when I do not want to type the same text over and over again.

That being said. A step by step guide on this plot can be found [here](https://medium.com/the-stata-guide/stata-graphs-waffle-charts-32afc7d6f6dd). 

Learning how to do it step-by-step gives your more flexibility, but I hope you will find that using [`waffle_i`](./waffle_i_files/waffle_i.ado) is sufficiently flexible for most of your purposes.

So let me start

## What is a waffle plot?

A *waffle* plot is a kind of *pie* chart (how interesting we like to name them as food), because it can be used to visualize sample compositions. It can also be considered as a stacked ***bar*** chart.

In contrast with a pie chart, where the information is displayed as pieces of a circle, a waffle plot shows the composition as dots in a box. Incidentally, it does look like a waffle...

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.cap="", center}
knitr::include_graphics("https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/60637186ceabd6ae3d2ebc7f/4:3/w_4136,h_3102,c_limit/CrispyWaffles_HERO_v2_032521_12048_JD_final.jpg")
```

## But what are they, really? 

If you want a more insider look of a waffle plot. They are nothing else than a ***scatter*** plot within a box, where all points and horizontally and vertically equidistant.

So at its core Waffle plots are easy to make. But they can be a bit time consuming. 

Thus, what I decided to do was write a small `ado` that makes creating this plots easily. 

In the next slides, I will show you how to use `waffle_i` to make this type of plots, in Stata!. But first...

1. Get a copy of [`waffle_i`](./waffle_i_files/waffle_i.ado) in your computer.
2. Get Asjad `schemepack` from SSC. I really like `white_tableau` scheme.

## Simple waffle plot

Say that you want to do a waffle plot, and want to show that 27% of individuals do something. If so, you will type:

```Stata
waffle_i 27
```

## Beautify

Good first attempt, but just not nice enough. So lets increase marker size, change marker symbol and get add labels.


```Stata 
waffle_i 27, msize(7)        /// Increase size of Dots
              msymbol(square) /// and change them to Squares
      legend(order(1 "The blues" 2 "The rest")) // ads Labels
```

## Beautify

You could also add more than one group and change colors


```Stata 
waffle_i 27 15 12, msize(7)        /// Increase size of Dots
              msymbol(square) /// and change them to Squares
              legend(off)  /// No labels
              color0(gs15) /// Color for the "rest"
              color(navy%80 navy%40 navy%20) ///colors
      			  title("What is this?") // Title
```

## Beautify

Or change from Square to Long Rectangular figure

```Stata 
waffle_i 27 15 12, msize(4.5)        /// Increase size of Dots
              msymbol(square) /// and change them to Squares
              legend(off)  /// No labels
              color0(gs15) /// Color for the "rest"
              color(navy%80 navy%40 navy%20) ///colors
      		    xnobs(25) ynobs(12) /// Changes Dimensions 
			        title("Who said no rectangles")
```

## Conclusions?

What else can I do?

Because `waffle_i` is just a collection of scatter plots, you can use most `twoway graph` options with this command. Although I have not tried all of them. So handle with care.

In any case, this command does the heavy lifiting, you can do the fineness.

But what is next?

Right now you can only "feed" values to command. Perhaps next, I ll make it so you can add variables. We will see!.

Comments? suggestions? Drop me a message!
