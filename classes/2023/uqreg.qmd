## Introduction

As we saw last class, conditional quantile regressions have only one purpose:

-   Analyze relationships between conditional distributions.

This is a very useful tool!. As it allows you to move beyond Average relationships.

-   How do people (who are not all average) would be affected by changes in $Xs$

There is a limitation, however. The effects you may estimate, will depend strongly on model specification.

-   This is similar to OVB. Changing covariates could drastically change the conditional distributions and associated coefficients

What if, you are interested in distributional effects across the whole population! Not only a subsample?

## E(q(y\|X)) is not Q(y)

One common mistake one makes when analyzing QRegressions is to make interpretations as if the average effects on the $qth$ conditional quantiles would be the same as the effect on the "overall" $qth$ quantile.

Except for few cases (when Quantile regressions are not relevant), CQ effects do not translate ***directly*** into Changes into the unconditional quantile.

However, as a policy maker, this would be the most relevant estimand you may be interested in :

-   How does improving education affect inequality?

-   Would eliminating Unionization would increase wage inequality?

-   Is there heterogeneity in consumption expenditure?

However, going from Conditional to unconditional statistics (not only Q) is not always straight forward.

## ⌚Wait...What do we mean unconditional?

One of the questions I read a lot regarding UQR is what do we mean unconditional?

-   This is perhaps a someone poor choice of words.

<!-- -->

-   Anytime we estimate **ANY** statistic, we condition on something.

    -   We condition on all individual characteristics (including errors)

    -   We condition on groups characteristics (CQREG and CEF)

    -   or, We condition on all characteristics (distributions). We happen to call this, unconditional statistics.

-   This, however, ***does*** make a big difference in interpretation.

## From Condition on Individuals,

### to conditioning on Distributions

$$
y_i = b_0 + b_1 x_i + e_i + x_i e_i \\
\frac{dy_i}{dx_i}=b_1 + e_i
$$

$$
E(y_i|x_i=x) = b_0 + b_1 x  \\
\frac{dE(y_i|x)}{dx}=b_1
$$ $$
E(E(y_i|x_i=x))=E(y_i) = b_0 + b_1 E(x_i)    \\
\frac{dE(y_i)}{dE(x_i)}=b_1
$$

Same effects, but different interpretations (specially last one)

## How are Unconditional effects Estimated?

Consider any distributional statistic $v$, which takes as arguments, all observations, density distributions $f()$, or cumulative distributions $F()$.

$$
v = v(F_y) \ or \ v(f_y) \ or \ v(y_1, y_2, ...,y_n)
$$

And to simplify notation, lets say this function is defined as follows:

$$
v(f_y) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty h(y,\theta) f(y)dy 
$$

This simply considers distributional statistics $v$ that can be estimated by simply integrating a transformation of $h(y,\theta)$ given a set of parameters $\theta$.

But for now, lets consider only the Identify function $h(y,\theta)=y$

but...What about 🎛️?

## Introducing controls

Assume there is a joint distribution of function $f(y,x)$, then

$$
f(y,x)=f(y|x)f(x) \\
f(y) = \int f(y|x) f(x) dx
$$

And all together:

$$
v(f_y) = \int y \int f(y|x) f(x) dx \ dy \\
v(f_y) = \iint y f(y|x) dy \ f(x) dx  \\
v(f_y) = \int  E(y|X) f(x) dx  \\
$$

## Or a bit more General

$$ v(f_y) = \iint h(y,\theta) f(y|x)f(x)dxdy $$ So, the statistic $v$ will change if:

\- We change the function $h$ or its parameters $\theta$.

\- Assume some shocks that change the conditional $f(y|x)$

\- or the distribution of characteristics change!

Note: $$ f(y|x) \sim \beta \\
f(x) \sim x $$

## Again...How are Unconditional effects Estimated?

In an ideal scenario, you simple get the data under to regimes (before and after changes in $x$), and do the following:

$$
\Delta v = v(f'_y)-v(f_y)
$$

That is, just estimate the statistic in two scenarios ($f'$ and $f$), and calculate the difference. (impossible!)

But there are (at least) three alternatives:

1.  Using Reweighting approaches to "reshape" the data: $f(x)$ (non-parametric)
2.  Identify $f(y|x)$ so one can simulate how $\Delta X$ affect y
3.  Focus on the statistic $v$ and indirectly identify the effects of interest. (RIF!)

## Op1: Re-weighting

Consider the following. there is a policy such that you plan to improve education in a country. Every single person will have at least 7 years of education, and will have free access to two additional years of education if they want to.

In other words, characteristics change from $f(x) \rightarrow g(x)$ . But you do not see this! $$ v(g_y) = \iint h(y,\theta) f(y|x) \color{red}{g(x)}dxdy $$

but perhaps, we could see this:

$$ \hat v(g_y) = \iint h(y,\theta) f(y|x) \color{red}{\hat w(x)}f(x) dxdy $$

if we can come up with a set of weights $\color{red}{\hat w(x)}$ such that $f(x)\hat w(x)=g(x)$

$$\hat w(x) = \frac{\hat g(x)}{\hat f(x)}$$

## Op1: Re-weighting

Simple, yet hard. Estimation of multivariate densities can be a difficult task. So assume the following

$$
f(x) = h(x|s=0) ; g(x) = h(x|s=1) 
$$

This makes things "easier".

1.  Bayes: $$h(x|s=k) = \frac{h(x)p(s=k|x)}{p(s=k)}$$ $$\hat w(x) = \frac{h(x)p(s=1|x)}{h(x)p(s=0|x)}\frac{p(s=0)}{p(s=1)}
    =\frac{p(s|x)}{1-p(s|x)} \frac{1-p(s)}{p(s)}$$

Easier to estimate conditional probabilities, (logit probit or other) than Densities!

Increasing fines, may reduce citations in about 1.3., but have almost no effect at the bottom of the distribution.

What about Standard errors? Bootstrap! (logit and estimation, probably clustering at individual level)

Easy to extend to other Statistics, but, can only provide results "within" support.

## Op2: Model Conditional Distribution

Say that you are interested in the same Policy, but do not trust re-weighting. Instead you want to model the Outcome, using some parametric or nonparametric analysis

1.  Define your model. Should be feasible enough to accommodate changes in the conditional distribution. (one "model" for each $X's$ combination?)
2.  Use the model to make predictions of your outcome (quite a few times). and summarize all results.

Options for flexible mode?

-   You can use Heteroskedastic OLS $y\sim N(x\beta,x\gamma)$ and predict from here

-   You can use CQregressions to simulate the results.

One of this is similar to what we do in simulation analysis, and imputation. The other is similar to the work of [Machado Mata (2005)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.788) and [Melly(2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537105000382). Where you invert the whole distribution "globally"

Very demanding (computationally) and may only capture effects to the extend that we have good coverage of the distribution.

Standard Errors...Bootstrapping. Perhaps use random quantile assignment, and may have problems near boundaries.

## Opt 1 and 2: Comments

The first two options allow you to estimate effects of changes in $f(x)$ on the unconditional distribution of $y$, and in consequence, the distributional statistics of interest.

They have limitations:

1.  They both are limited to a single experiment. A different policy requires a change in the setup.
2.  Reweighing is simple to apply, but has limitation on the type of policies. They all need to be within the support of $X$
3.  Modeling the conditional distribution is a more direct approach, but more computationally intensive, specially for obtaining Stand errors.

## Opt 3. Local Approximation: RIF regression

The third approach was first introduced by [Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux 2009](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40263848), as a computationally simple way to analyze how changes in $X's$ affect the unconditional quantiles of $y$.

This strategy was later extended to analyze the effects on a myriad of distributional statistics and rank dependent indices. as well as an approach to estimate distributional treatment effects. See [Rios-Avila (2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X20909690).

In contrast with other approaches, it can be used to analyze multiple types of policies without re-estimating the model. However the identification and interpretation needs particular attention.

It also allows you to easily make Statistical inference. (except for quantiles...)

## Opt 3. From ground up

Reconsider the Original question. How do you capture the effect of changes of distribution of $x$ on the distribution of $y$.

$$
\Delta v=v(G_y) - v(F_y) 
$$

Now, assume that $G_y$ is just marginally different from $F_y$ (different in a very particular way)

$$
G_y(y_i) = (1-\epsilon)F_y+ \epsilon 1(y>y_i)
$$

This function puts just a bit more weight on observation $y_i$. Think of it as "dropping" a new person in the pool.

If this is the case, the $\Delta v(y_i)$ Captures how would the Statistic $v$ changes if the distribution puts just a bit extra weight on 1 observation. (this would be very small)

## Opt 3. One more thing

Lets Rescale it:

$$
IF(v,F_y,y_i) =lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{v(G_y(y_i))-v(F_y)}{\epsilon}
$$

The **influence function** is a measure of direction of change, we should expect the statistic $v$ will have as we change $F_y \rightarrow G_y$ .

From here the RIF is just $RIF(v,F_y,y_i) = v + IF(v,F_y,y_i)$

Which has some properties:

$$
\begin{align}
\int IF(v,F_y,y_i)f_ydy=0 &; 
\int RIF(v,F_y,y_i)f_y dy=v \\
v(F_y) \sim N \left(v(F_y),\frac{\sigma^2_{IF}}{N} \right) &;
\int IF^2f_ydy =\sigma^2_{IF}
\end{align}
$$

## Opt 3. RIF Regression

First:

$$
v(F_y) = \iint RIF(v,F_Y,y_i) f(y|x)f(x)dy = \int E(RIF(.)|x) f(x)
$$

From here is similar to Opt 3. Use ***some*** econometric model to estimate $E(RIF(.)|X)$, and use that to make predictions on how $v(F_y)$ would change, when there is a **distributional change** in $X$.

RIF-OLS: Unconditional effect!

$$
RIF(v,F_y,y_i) = X\beta+e  \ \rightarrow\ 
E(RIF) = v(F_y) = \bar X \beta \\
\frac{dv(F_y)}{d\bar X}=\beta
$$

Logic. When $F_x$ changes, it will change the distribution of $F_y$, which will affect how the statistic $v$ will change. But, we can only consider changes in means! (and Var)

## Why it works, and why it may not

RIF regressions works by using a linear approximation of the statistic $v$ with the changes in $F_y$ which are caused by changes in $F_x$, proxied by changes in $\bar X$.

-   Changes at the individual $x_i$ are not interesting (in a population of 1million, what happens to person 99 may not be large enough to matter)

Depending on the model specification, however, we may only be able to identify changes in first and second moments of the distribution of $x$. (Mean and variance).

\-

However, as any linear approximation to a non-linear function, the approximations are BAD when the changes in $F_x$ are too large. The most relevant example...Dummies and treatment!

## RIF-Reg and dummies

Dummies are a challenge. At individual or conditional level, we usually consider changes from 0 to 1 (off or on).

-   For unconditional effects this is not correct (too large of a change) (No-one treated vs All treated). Thus you need to change the question...Not on and off changes, but Changes in proportion of treated!

    -   Very important. a 1% increase in pop treated is different if current treatment is 10% or 90%.

-   However, its possible to restructure RIF regressions to be partially conditional (Rios-Avila and Maroto 2023) (Combines CQREG with UQREG)

-   Similar problems are experienced if the change in continuous variables is large!

    -   Minor point. How do you construct RIFs? (analytically and Empirically)

## Example

``` stata
webuse dui, clear
**  Consider the policy change
gen change_fines= 0.1*(12-fines)
**  consider average change in fines.Since we are only considering this effect
sum change_fines

Consider the basic change. Fines increases in 1 unit, Cntys with taxes, increase 10%, etc

Or consider rescaled effects

## Other Considerations  {.scrollable}

RIF Regressions are useful, but again, one must use them with care.

-   Only Small changes! Larger changes may be meaningless

Except for `Stata` (see rif and rifhdreg), the applications of RIF regressions outside Mean, Variance and Quantiles are non-existent. (paper?)

-   For most Common Statistics, RIF's automatically provide correct Standard errors (which can be Robustized!). In fact, a simple **LR** can be considered as a special case of **RIF's**

$$
 RIF(mean,y_i,F_y) = y_i ; 
 RIF(variance,y_i,F_y) = (y_i-\bar y)^2 ;\\\
RIF(Q,y_i,F_Y) = Q_y(\tau) + \frac{\tau-1(y_i \leq Q_y(\tau))}{f_Y(y_i)}
$$

Except for quantile related functions! ($f_y$ also needs estimation, thus errors!)

-   Accounting for "local" unconditional effects beyond means require Center Polynomials:

$$
RIF(.,y) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 (x-\bar x)^2+\varepsilon
$$

-   Quantile treatment effects (on and off) are possible using PC-RIF (When you condition the distribution on just 1 variable)

$$
RIF(.,F_{Y|D},y) = b_0 + b_1 D+b_2 x + b_3 (x-\bar x)^2+\varepsilon
$$

## Final words on RIF

Because this implementation uses LR, you can add Multiple Fixed effects as well. (with limitations)

And you can skip LR all together, and model RIF using Other approaches! (which may be even better than OLS).

# NEXT

Truly going nonlinear. When $\beta$ is no longer linear in $y$ (nor is the error)
