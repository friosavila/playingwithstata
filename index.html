<h1 >Welcome to Playing with Stata</h1>
<h2 >Random topics, and interesting questions (at least to me) using my tool of Choice Stata!</p>

<p>Welcome, and thanks for joining me.  As you will read in this "blog" (a description I'm not too fond of)/site, I cover series of random topics of questions in applied econometrics using my favorite tool Stata!. </p>
<br><br>

<p>That being said. This website is multipurpose. </p>
<br><br>
<p>I started it to answer random questions of "how to" do things in Stata, that I had troubles with at some point. Spread the knowledge if you may. However it will also be used as a teaching tool for some simple and not-so-simple topics and strategies I teach in econometrics class.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Finally, I will also use it as a platform to share my research, whenever possible, and pertinent. </p>
<br><br>
<p>Feel free to drop me a line, comment or question.</p>
